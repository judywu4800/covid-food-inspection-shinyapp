Term: Fall 2022

+ **Project title**: DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results [link](https://judywu.shinyapps.io/foodinspection/)

+ **Team members**:
	+ Kieu-Giang Nguyen, kn2521@columbia.edu
	+ Zhejing Shi, zs2524@columbia.edu
	+ Judy Wu, dw2936@columbia.edu

+ **Project summary**: In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, our app provides ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how COVID-19 has impacted restaurant inspection activities in NYC from different perspectives, which then allows city officials to consolidate trends from different neighborhoods and different time periods to make meaningful comparison.


+ **Additional note**: Under the shinny app, the interactive map of number of violations may run slowly due to excessive amount of data. Alternatively, this map can be viewed via HTML file under doc folder.

This folder is orgarnized as follows.
